## 2026-08-03 — M1 · `M1-T02` Dev dependencies and quality baseline

**Task:** M1-T02 (complete)
**Branch:** `chore/dev-dependencies`
**Scientific impact:** none — `capture.py` reports `characterization baseline stable (9 groups)`
after the environment change

### Done

- `[dependency-groups] dev` added to `pyproject.toml`: pytest, pytest-cov, ruff, mypy
- `uv sync`; `uv.lock` gained **only** tooling packages — no runtime version moved.
  Verified against the golden `_meta` pins: torch 2.7.1+cu118, NumPy 2.4.4, SciPy 1.17.1,
  scikit-image 0.26.0 — all unchanged, which is why the golden is still stable

| Tool | Version |
|---|---|
| pytest | 9.1.1 |
| pytest-cov | 7.1.0 |
| ruff | 0.16.1 |
| mypy | 2.3.0 |

### Baseline — the M2 burn-down target

Measured, nothing fixed. These are the numbers M2 has to drive to zero.

**ruff — 196 findings total, 108 in `src/`** (66 auto-fixable)

| Rule | src/ | What it is |
|---|---:|---|
| RUF002/003/001 | **44** | ambiguous unicode in docstrings, comments, strings — this is the Russian text of **D-22**, found mechanically |
| T201 | **13** | `print` in library code — **exactly the 13 the audit counted by hand** |
| F401 | 11 | unused imports |
| I001 | 11 | unsorted imports |
| W293/W292/W291 | 10 | whitespace |
| RET504/505 | 7 | unnecessary assign / superfluous else |
| RUF046 | 2 | unnecessary `int()` cast — **adjacent to D-10**, the opening-radius rounding defect |
| RUF013 | 2 | implicit `Optional` — the unknown-scale contract (**D-07**) |
| A005 | 1 | `src/types.py` shadows the stdlib `types` module — a real M2-T02 constraint |
| others | 7 | B007, C408, N806, PIE790, RUF022, SIM108, UP037 |

The remaining 88 findings are in notebooks, `preprocess_batch.py` and
`tests/characterization/capture.py`.

**mypy — 30 errors in 9 files** (default settings, no configuration yet)

| Code | Count |
|---|---:|
| import-untyped | 8 |
| assignment | 7 |
| arg-type | 6 |
| return-value | 3 |
| attr-defined | 3 |
| has-type, empty-body, call-overload | 3 |

The most interesting one is static confirmation of a known runtime defect:

```
src/pipeline.py:110: error: Argument 4 to "run_sam2_from_blobs" has incompatible type
"ndarray[...] | None"; expected "ndarray[...]"
```

That is the SEM/TEM path, where `z_flat` is `None` by construction (`pipeline.py:53`).
A type checker would have caught it before it ever ran.

**pytest — 1 test, 1 failed**

```
FAILED tests/test_io.py::test_load_spm - FileNotFoundError: 'data/5.011'
```

Correction to the prediction in `CURRENT_TASK.md`: the test does not pass vacuously, it
**fails**. It catches `ImportError` while `load_afm` raises `FileNotFoundError` (audit
D-20), and the path is absent from a clean checkout. The suite has been red the whole
time; nobody could see it because pytest was never installed. M1-T06 replaces it.

### Side effect worth knowing about

`uv sync` uninstalled three packages that were in the environment but not in `uv.lock`:
`clip` (from the ultralytics CLIP repo), `ftfy`, `regex`. They were installed outside uv,
so `uv sync` removed them to match the lock — expected behaviour, but not something I
intended.

Nothing under `src/` imports them; they are needed only for **YOLO-World** models, and
`checkpoints/yolov8s-world.pt` is such a model (it is not the configured default —
`PipelineConfig.yolo_model_path` points at `best12x.pt`). If YOLO-World is wanted, the
fix is to declare it as a real dependency rather than let it be installed ad hoc:

```bash
uv add "clip @ git+https://github.com/ultralytics/CLIP.git"
```

Recorded as backlog **B-055**.

### Not done, deliberately

No finding was fixed. Repairing the ruff configuration is M1-T03, the mypy configuration
is M1-T04, and the 108 `src/` findings are M2 work — under the protection of the golden
file, not before it.

### Next

`M1-T03` — repair the ruff configuration. It currently emits a deprecation warning for
top-level `select`/`ignore`, targets `py311` on a 3.12 project, still carries
`known-first-party = ["your_package_name"]`, and — most importantly — sets `fix = true`,
so `ruff check .` rewrites source files as a side effect of being asked a question.

## 2026-08-03 — M1 · `M1-T01` Repository hygiene

**Task:** M1-T01 (complete), M1-T11 (complete — absorbed)
**Branch:** `chore/repo-hygiene`
**Scientific impact:** none — `capture.py` reports `characterization baseline stable (9 groups)`

### Result

| Metric | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| Tracked files | 2 877 | **77** |
| Tracked under `frontend/node_modules` | 2 800 | **0** |
| Tracked model weights | 1 (`yolov8s-world.pt`, 26 MB, staged) | **0** |
| Largest tracked non-notebook file | 6.5 MB | 3.2 MB (README figure) |

### Done

- `git rm -r --cached frontend/node_modules` — 2 800 files untracked, all still on disk
- `git rm --cached yolov8s-world.pt` — the 26 MB blob (`2fa1b38`) was staged for addition
  and would have entered history on the next `git commit` without a pathspec. Removed
  from the index before that happened; the file is not on disk and the four real
  checkpoints under `checkpoints/` are untouched
- `.gitignore` rewritten: added `node_modules/`, `output/`, `*.pt`, `*.pth`, `*.onnx`,
  `*.safetensors`, `*.zip`, `*.tar.gz`, `build/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`, `.mypy_cache/`,
  `.coverage`, `htmlcov/`; grouped and commented by rationale
- `.claude/settings.json` now **tracked** — agent configuration is shared (PROJECT_RULES §7).
  `.claude/settings.local.json` (per-machine permissions) stays ignored. This completes
  the `.gitignore` edit that was already sitting uncommitted in the working tree
- **Junk removed from disk:**
  - `.zip` — a 22-byte *empty* zip archive, tracked since February
  - `__pycache__/` × 4, including `.pyc` files for modules that no longer exist
    (`sam2_pipeline`, `config`, `detection`) and bytecode from CPython 3.14 while the
    venv is 3.12 — stale in two independent ways
  - `.pytest_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`
  - `output/`, `notebooks/` — both empty directories
  - root `package-lock.json` — an empty stray from an accidental `npm install` at the
    repository root (the real one is `frontend/package-lock.json`)
- `plan.md` → `docs/archive/plan-frontend-react-client.md`, un-ignored and now tracked,
  with an ARCHIVED header pointing at ADR-0007. It was gitignored, so the only record of
  the intended HTTP contract was unshareable. Path references in ADR-0007 updated
  (editorial only — the decision is unchanged)

### Deviation from the stated Definition of Done

"Largest tracked file, excluding the pre-existing notebooks, < 1 MB" is **not met**:
`images/yolo_sam2_comparison.png` (3.2 MB) and `images/log.png` (3.0 MB) are README
figures. They are legitimate content, not junk, and untracking them would break the
README. Recorded as backlog **B-054** (optimise figures) rather than silently ignored.

The notebooks (6.5 MB + 2.2 MB, committed with outputs) are untouched — that is M1-T09.

### Not done, deliberately

History still carries the 78 MB: `git rm --cached` stops the growth, it does not shrink
`.git` (still 81 MB). Rewriting history invalidates every clone and needs the operator's
approval — backlog **B-040**.

### Next

`M1-T02` — declare `pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `ruff`, `mypy` as dev dependencies. None of
them is installed today, so the quality gate does not exist yet; the characterization
runner is currently the only working check.

## 2026-08-03 — M0 · Engineering foundation

**Tasks:** M0-T01 … M0-T08 (all complete)
**Branch:** `docs/engineering-infrastructure`
**Base:** `11e0ecc` (frontend init)
**Code changed:** none — documentation only, by design

### Done

- Read `systempromt.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `README.md`, plus `project.md`, `plan.md`,
  the Phase 0 audit and the characterization baseline
- Analysed the repository directly: 12 modules / 2 021 LOC under `src/`, 13 frontend
  source files, 8 characterization phantoms, 2 854 tracked files
- Recorded 7 strengths and 16 weaknesses with measured evidence → `Architecture.md` §2
- Defined the target Clean Architecture: `app` / `core` / `application` / `infrastructure` /
  `gui` / `resources`, with an enforced dependency rule and a layer-contract table
- Wrote the constitution → `PROJECT_RULES.md`
- Broke the project into 10 milestones (M0–M9) with exit criteria → `Roadmap.md`
- Broke the milestones into 110 tasks → `TASKS.md`
- Wrote 11 ADRs (0001–0011) → `docs/ADR/`
- Established the state protocol → `STATE.md`, `CURRENT_TASK.md`, this file
- Selected `M1-T01` as the first task

### Learned

- **The starting position is better than a greenfield.** A completed, *reproduced* Phase 0
  audit and a committed golden baseline over 8 seeded phantoms already exist. That changes
  the strategy: the domain can be moved aggressively, because drift is detectable to
  `rtol=1e-6`.
- **The stack pivoted.** The previous direction was React + a FastAPI backend that was
  never written; the target is a Qt6 desktop application. The React client is the only
  work made obsolete by the pivot, and it is parked rather than deleted (ADR-0007).
- **The domain layer is genuinely worth preserving.** A modality-neutral `Detection`, a
  `BaseDetector` ABC, lazily imported SAM2 and a deliberate dependency root mean the
  Clean Architecture target is an extraction, not a rewrite.
- **Two problems are urgent for different reasons.** `node_modules` (98% of tracked files)
  makes review impossible; the staged `yolov8s-world.pt` has a closing window before it
  is permanently in history. Both are M1-T01.
- **Structure must precede correctness.** Fixing D-03 or D-04 today would change numbers
  inside a codebase with 5 import cycles and no test gate. M2 before M3 is not
  bureaucracy — it is the only way the deltas stay attributable.

### Open questions raised

B1 package name · B2 `min_size_nm` semantics · B3 detection polarity · B4 opening-radius
rounding · B5 fate of `frontend/` and the notebooks · B6 real sample data in git.
Full text in `STATE.md`. None blocks M1.

### Next

Execute `M1-T01` on branch `chore/repo-hygiene`: untrack `frontend/node_modules` and
`yolov8s-world.pt`, rewrite `.gitignore`. See `CURRENT_TASK.md`.
